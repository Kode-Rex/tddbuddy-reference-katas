# TDD Buddy — Reference Kata Implementations

Teaching implementations of selected [TDD Buddy](https://www.tddbuddy.com) katas, showcasing the disciplines that make tests function as specifications for humans and AI agents alike:

- **Test Data Builders** — composable, fluent APIs for constructing scenarios
- **Object Mothers** — canonical named instances of domain concepts
- **Scenario Factories** — preconfigured worlds that tests tweak from a coherent baseline
- **Ubiquitous Language** — vocabulary that flows end to end, from business conversation to test name to domain type
- **Domain Types** — `Money`, `SKU`, `Quantity`, not `decimal`, `string`, `int`
- **Mocks as Behavioral Specifications** — used only where collaboration *is* the behavior

These aren't the smallest solutions that pass the tests. They're the solutions that demonstrate how to make tests serve as the product surface of your codebase — the artifact that humans, new hires, and AI agents all operate against.

## Gears — Bridging TDD and BDD

A misconception that dogs TDD discussions: "TDD means tiny red-green-refactor cycles, one assertion at a time." That's one gear. TDD is many gears.

Kent Beck's framing: you **shift gears** based on confidence.

- **Low gear** — fake-it, triangulation, one assertion at a time. Use this when the territory is unfamiliar, the design is uncertain, or a bug is hiding and you need the smallest reliable step.
- **Middle gear** — one scenario per cycle. A test drives a complete behavior, not a single branch. Most of a mature codebase lives here.
- **High gear** — write the whole obvious implementation. Used when the path is clear, the pattern is familiar from neighboring code, or you're porting a well-specified solution to a new language.

**This is where TDD meets BDD.** BDD asks you to write executable specifications at the level of *behavior*, not *branches*. That's middle/high gear. It doesn't replace TDD — it's the gear you shift into once the domain is understood well enough that each scenario *is* a single step.

**The techniques don't change between gears.** Test data builders, ubiquitous language, domain types, mocks-as-specifications — all apply identically at every tempo. What changes is how many scenarios you take in one stride.

Picking the wrong gear is its own failure mode. Low gear on a solved problem is theatre. High gear on an unfamiliar domain is reckless. The skill is knowing when to shift.

## Three Teaching Modes

This repo answers three different questions, and each kata is written in the mode that fits:

### 1. Pedagogy — learn the TDD rhythm

For humans who want to **feel** the TDD cycle: red → green → reflect → refactor, with gears visibly shifting as understanding accrues. Commits land one per cycle, not one per scenario. Walkthroughs narrate *why* each step was taken and when the gear shifted up.

These are the classic TDD teaching katas — small enough that the whole arc fits in the reader's head, rich enough that real design choices emerge.

**Included:** `string-calculator`, `prime-factors`, `bowling-game`, `tennis-score`, `roman-numerals` (five-kata pedagogy set).

### 2. Specification — tests as the system's surface

For teams who want to see **what tests look like when they are the spec**: one commit per scenario, test names are domain sentences, builders and ubiquitous language from scenario one. No visible refactor churn — the design is already understood; each commit adds one behavior.

This is what a mature team's tests read like after the design has settled. It's also what an AI agent operating against your tests should experience.

**Included:** `gilded-rose` (low gear, commit-per-scenario).

### 3. Agent Full-Bake — how we do it with AI

For the question "what does TDD-done-well-by-an-AI look like?": one commit per language, full domain design landing together, walkthrough explaining the design rationale. The tests are still the spec — but the commit history doesn't pretend to be the learning journey.

This is the honest shape of AI-assisted TDD: the agent understands the domain from the kata brief, writes the whole thing to the quality bar, and documents *why* it came out that shape. The commit log is a delivery log, not a learning log.

**Included:** `bank-account`, and the vast majority of remaining katas.

**You can tell which mode a kata is in by its walkthrough.** Pedagogy walkthroughs step through cycles and show gear shifts. Specification walkthroughs table-of-commits. Full-bake walkthroughs read as design rationale.

## Why This Repo Exists

The [TDD Buddy blog](https://www.tddbuddy.com/blog) argues — across a three-part arc — that the bar for TDD has moved. Agents shifted the audience for tests from humans-with-context to agents-without, and that raised what "good tests" means:

1. [TDD Already Does BDD — Without the Gherkin](https://www.tddbuddy.com/blog/tdd-already-does-bdd/) — the craft case
2. [BDD Was a Coordination Tax — AI Just Repriced It](https://www.tddbuddy.com/blog/bdd-was-a-coordination-tax/) — the org case
3. [The Bar for TDD Just Moved](https://www.tddbuddy.com/blog/the-bar-for-tdd-just-moved/) — the new floor

This repo is the concrete companion. Every kata here applies the techniques the arc describes.

## Layout

Each kata has:

```
<kata-slug>/
├── README.md          — what this kata teaches, which patterns it showcases
├── SCENARIOS.md       — the scenarios all three languages implement (the shared spec)
├── csharp/
│   ├── README.md      — how to build and run
│   ├── WALKTHROUGH.md — commit-by-commit teaching walkthrough
│   ├── src/           — implementation project
│   └── tests/         — test project
├── typescript/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── WALKTHROUGH.md
│   ├── src/
│   └── tests/
└── python/
    ├── README.md
    ├── WALKTHROUGH.md
    ├── src/
    └── tests/
```

**Same scenarios. Same vocabulary. Three idiomatic implementations.**

The test names, domain concepts, and scenario structure are identical across languages. Only the language-specific syntax differs. This is deliberate — the vocabulary of the business should not depend on which programming language a team happens to be using.

## How to Read a Kata

1. Start with the kata's top-level `README.md` — the patterns being taught and why this kata showcases them.
2. Read `SCENARIOS.md` — the shared specification. This is what all three implementations satisfy.
3. Pick your language and read its `WALKTHROUGH.md` — a commit-by-commit tour of how the solution was built, with links to the commits themselves.
4. Read the final code. Each file is written to be read — named in domain language, small in scope, composable through builders and factories.

## Reading the Commit History

Each language folder has a meaningful commit history. Reading `git log` for any language folder should read like a narrative of how TDD actually unfolds:

```
commit 12 — Refactor: extract ItemCategory to replace stringly-typed categories
commit 11 — Green: loyalty discount applies to legendary items correctly
commit 10 — Red: loyalty members get discount on legendary items
commit 09 — Refactor: extract aLegendaryItem() builder
commit 08 — Green: legendary items do not degrade
commit 07 — Red: legendary items do not degrade in quality
commit 06 — Refactor: introduce Item builder with sensible defaults
...
```

The walkthrough doc links each named step to its commit so the reader can check out any point in the TDD cycle and see exactly what the code looked like.

More katas will be added as the reference set grows. Algorithmic katas like Prime Factors and Roman Numerals appear here in **Pedagogy mode** — the algorithm-emerges-from-triangulation arc is itself the teaching point. Domain-heavy katas appear in **Agent Full-Bake mode** with builders and ubiquitous language. Straightforward one-liner solutions for every TDD Buddy kata in many languages live in the main [tddbuddy-solutions](https://github.com/Kode-Rex/tddbuddy-solutions) repo.

## Contributing

This is a teaching repo. Pull requests that add a new kata, improve a walkthrough, or translate an existing kata into a new language are welcome. The bar:

- Scenarios are shared across all three languages (if adding a new kata, start with `SCENARIOS.md`)
- Test names use domain language, not implementation language
- Setup uses builders; primitives only where a primitive is the domain concept
- Commit history reads as a teaching narrative
